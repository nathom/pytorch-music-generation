\section*{Introduction}

From classical era music to modern hip-hop, music has been ingrained in human culture for thousands of years. The idea of creating music is assumed to be a task only accomplishable by humans. But with a large sample of composed music, a recurrent network model, and some computational power, we can generate music without the interventions of humans. A long short-term memory network (LSTM) is an type of RNN that uses gates to control the flow of information in and out of the network. LSTMs are great at predicting sequences of information based on input information. With this in mind, our goal is to generate music from a short prompt of musical characters. We can accomplish this task with a character-level LSTM.
