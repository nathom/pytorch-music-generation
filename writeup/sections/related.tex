\subsection*{Long Short-Term Memory}
\cite{lstm} proposes a modified recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture designed to overcome the vanishing gradient problem in traditional RNNs. LSTM networks are capable of learning long-term dependencies in sequential data by utilizing a memory cell and a set of gates to regulate the flow of information. This paper provides deeper intuition behind why LSTM works for music generation.

\subsection*{Deep Learning Techniques for Music Generation} 
\cite{briot} discusse the application of deep learning techniques, particularly recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for music generation. The paper explores various approaches for modeling musical data, including symbolic representations (e.g., MIDI) and raw audio waveforms. This paper provides deeper intuition behind why RNNs are effective at music generation.
