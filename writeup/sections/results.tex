\section*{Results}
In the Results section, you should demonstrate your baseline modelâ€™s performance, performances for each of the parts of Q3, Q4, Q5 and Q6 (training, generation, hyperparameter tuning, feature evaluation).
You are expected to report the following things in your submission:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
  \item Report results for your baseline model, a 1-hidden layer LSTM with 150 neurons. (2 pt)
  \item Report the three generated music samples with the above-mentioned three different Temperature (T) settings. Submit their .txt and .midi files as a part of your gradescope submission. (3 pt)
  \item  Report loss plots for hyperparameter tuning experiments namely: RNNs vs LSTMs, changing number of neurons in the hidden layer and varying dropouts. (6 pt)
  \item Report heatmaps with appropriate scales, for three different neurons from your best-trained model. (3 pt)
\end{enumerate}
