\section*{Methods}
In the Methods section, you should describe the implementation and architectural details of your system - in particular, this addresses how you approached the problem and the design of your solution. For those who believe in reproducible science, this should be fine-grained enough such that somebody could implement your model/algorithm and reproduce the results you claim to achieve.
\subsection*{Training network using Teacher forcing}
Describe the LSTM architecture, the training procedure, the loss criterion, the optimizer you used.
\subsection*{Song Generation}
Describe the approach you took to generate a song by priming the network with an initial sequence given to it. You should also discuss the details of incorporating Temperature (T) in generating the output.
\subsection*{Hyper-parameter Tuning}
Describe the RNN architecture you used in 5.a and briefly describe the approach you took in tuning your hyperparameters.
\subsection*{Feature Evaluation}
Describe why it is important to do feature evaluation. Describe the approach you took in generating the Heatmap of the activationâ€™s of each neurons for each of the characters.
